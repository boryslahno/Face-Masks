                    <p class="about__text">
                        <strong>The N95 mask</strong> is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the nose and
                        mouth to help
                        minimise the chance of inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a
                        disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process
                        called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms
                        the filtration layer capable of filtering out at <strong>least 95%</strong> of airborne
                        particles when worn
                        correctly.
                        <br/><br/>
                        During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of intense air pollution, wearing
                        <strong>N95 masks</strong> has been shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air,
                        filtering out nasty
                        pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing respiratory problems.
                        Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy
                        and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from
                        wearing face masks while they are out in public and unable to control the breathing environments
                        that they find themselves in.

                        N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
                    </h2>
                    <p class="about__text">
                        Most <strong>N95 respirators</strong> are manufactured for use in construction and other
                        industrial type jobs
                        that expose workers to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National Personal
                        Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
                        Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
                        <br/><br/>
                        However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care setting. Specifically,
                        single-use, disposable respiratory protective devices used and worn by health care personnel
                        during procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer of
                        microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class
                        II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
